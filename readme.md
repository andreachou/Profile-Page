## Coding Dojo Core Assignment

### Objectives:

* Use what we've learned about CSS to recreate the following website

This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.

This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as CSS can be time consuming. We strongly suggest working in groups, pair programming is a common programming practice.
